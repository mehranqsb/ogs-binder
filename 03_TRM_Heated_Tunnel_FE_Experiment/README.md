# Heated Tunnel Problem — TRM (HE/FE Experiment)

"FE" stands for the Full-scale Emplacement heater experiment at the
Mont Terri rock laboratory (not "finite element").

Coupled THM simulation of a heat-emitting tunnel (bentonite buffer in
Opalinus Clay) with the OpenGeoSys `THERMO_RICHARDS_MECHANICS` process,
following the fully saturated TRM-S case of Pitz et al. (2023), IJRMMS 170,
105534 (DECOVALEX 2023 Task C; the reference paper is included as a PDF).
The workflow mirrors the Kirsch example in `../01_Tunnel_Excavation_Kirsch/`.

## Contents

### Notebook and scripts

- `03_trm_heated_tunnel.ipynb` — main notebook: parameters, mesh and project
  generation, OGS run, temperature/pressure histories and contours.
- `mesh_tunnel_trm.py` — `MeshGenerator`, adapted from the Kirsch example's
  transfinite quarter model: buffer ring (MaterialID 0) and clay
  (MaterialID 1), boundaries `left/right/top/bottom/arc_inner/arc_outer`.
- `prj_trm.py` — `PrjGenerator` for the TRM process (two media, orthotropic
  clay with local coordinate system, heater Neumann BC); all values come
  from the notebook.

### OGS input

- `_prj/trm_tunnel.prj` — generated project file.
- `input_meshes_trm/` — generated quadratic meshes; results are written to `_out/`.

### Model summary

Quarter of a 50 m × 50 m domain; heater surface at r = 0.525 m, tunnel wall
at R = 1.24 m. Heater heat flux 89 W/m² on `arc_inner`; rollers on all outer
boundaries; heater surface fixed; hydraulic/thermal boundaries otherwise
natural. Initial state: 15 °C, zero pore pressure, fully saturated. Heating
phase of 5 years; SparseLU (scaled) direct solver.

### Binder copy

Copied from `OGS_Course_2026/03_TRM_Heated_Tunnel_FE_Experiment`.
Previous outputs, the fine-reference run, notebook checkpoints, Python caches,
and the earlier `legacy_thm/` archive are excluded. Supporting paper data and
reference documents are retained. The first notebook code cell selects this
directory automatically. Binder launch links are in the repository root.

The notebook has been checked for syntax and working-directory setup; a full
simulation in Binder has not yet been verified.

## How to run

Open `03_trm_heated_tunnel.ipynb` in Jupyter (requires `ogstools`, `gmsh`, `pyvista`,
and OGS). Running all cells regenerates the meshes and project file, runs
OGS into `_out/`, and produces the result plots.
